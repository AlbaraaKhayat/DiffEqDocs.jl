# [Event Handling and Callback Functions](@id callbacks)

DifferentialEquations.jl allows for using callback functions to inject user code
into the solver algorithms. It allows for safely and accurately applying events
and discontinuities. Multiple callbacks can be chained together, and these callback
types can be used to build libraries of extension behavior.

## The Callback Types

The callback types are defined as follows. There are three primitive callback types: the
`ContinuousCallback`, `DiscreteCallback` and the `VectorContinuousCallback`. The [`ContinuousCallback`](@ref) is
applied when a continuous condition function hits zero. This type of callback
implements what is known in other problem solving environments as an Event. A
[`DiscreteCallback`](@ref) is applied when its `condition` function is `true`. The [`VectorContinuousCallback`](@ref) works 
like a vector of `ContinuousCallbacks` and lets the user specify which callback is called when.

### ContinuousCallback

### [DiscreteCallback](@id discrete_callback)

```@docs
DiscreteCallback
```

### CallbackSet

```@docs
CallbackSet
```

### VectorContinuousCallback

```@docs
VectorContinuousCallback
```

## Using Callbacks

The callback type is then sent to the solver (or the integrator) via the `callback`
keyword argument:

```julia
sol = solve(prob,alg,callback=cb)
```

You can supply `nothing`, a single `DiscreteCallback` or `ContinuousCallback` or `VectorContinuousCallback`,
or a `CallbackSet`.

### Note About Saving

When a callback is supplied, the default saving behavior is turned off. This is
because otherwise events would "double save" one of the values. To re-enable
the standard saving behavior, one must have the first `save_positions` value
be true for at least one callback.

### Modifying the Stepping Within A Callback

A common issue with callbacks is that they cause a large discontinuous change,
and so it may be wise to pull down `dt` after such a change. To control the
timestepping from a callback, please see [the timestepping controls in the integrator interface](@ref stepping_controls). Specifically, `set_proposed_dt!` is used to set the next stepsize,
and `terminate!` can be used to cause the simulation to stop.

## DiscreteCallback Examples

### Example 1: Interventions at Preset Times

Assume we have a patient whose internal drug concentration follows exponential decay, i.e. the linear ODE with
a negative coefficient:

```julia
using DifferentialEquations
function f(du,u,p,t)
    du[1] = -u[1]
end
u0 = [10.0]
const V = 1
prob = ODEProblem(f,u0,(0.0,10.0))
sol = solve(prob,Tsit5())
using Plots; plot(sol)
```

![Linear Decay](../assets/lineardecay.png)

Now assume we wish to give the patient a dose of 10 at time `t==4`. For this,
we can use a `DiscreteCallback` which will only be true at `t==4`:

```julia
condition(u,t,integrator) = t==4
affect!(integrator) = integrator.u[1] += 10
cb = DiscreteCallback(condition,affect!)
```



If we then solve with this callback enabled, we see no change:

```julia
sol = solve(prob,Tsit5(),callback=cb)
plot(sol)
```

![Linear Decay](../assets/lineardecay.png)


The reason there is no change is because the `DiscreteCallback` only applies at
a specific time, and the integrator never hit that time. Thus we would like to
force the ODE solver to step exactly at `t=4` so that the condition can be applied.
We can do that with the `tstops` argument:

```julia
sol = solve(prob,Tsit5(),callback=cb,tstops=[4.0])
plot(sol)
```

![Linear Decay Dose](../assets/lineardecay_dose.png)

and thus we achieve the desired result.

Performing multiple doses then just requires that we have multiple points which
are hit. For example, to dose at time `t=4` and `t=8`, we can do the following:

```julia
dosetimes = [4.0,8.0]
condition(u,t,integrator) = t ∈ dosetimes
affect!(integrator) = integrator.u[1] += 10
cb = DiscreteCallback(condition,affect!)
sol = solve(prob,Tsit5(),callback=cb,tstops=dosetimes)
plot(sol)
```

![Linear Decay Dose](../assets/lineardecay_2dose.png)

We can then use this mechanism to make the model arbitrarily complex. For
example, let's say there's now 3 dose times, but the dose only triggers if the
current concentration is below 1.0. Additionally, the dose is now `10t` instead
of just `10`. This model is implemented as simply:

```julia
dosetimes = [4.0,6.0,8.0]
condition(u,t,integrator) = t ∈ dosetimes && (u[1] < 1.0)
affect!(integrator) = integrator.u[1] += 10integrator.t
cb = DiscreteCallback(condition,affect!)
sol = solve(prob,Tsit5(),callback=cb,tstops=dosetimes)
plot(sol)
```

![Linear Decay Dose](../assets/lineardecay_2dose_complex.png)

#### PresetTimeCallback

Because events at preset times is a very common occurrence,
DifferentialEquations.jl provides a pre-built callback in the [Callback Library](@ref callback_library).
The `PresetTimeCallback(tstops,affect!)` takes an array of times and an `affect!`
function to apply. Thus to do the simple 2 dose example with this callback, we
could do the following:

```julia
dosetimes = [4.0,8.0]
affect!(integrator) = integrator.u[1] += 10
cb = PresetTimeCallback(dosetimes,affect!)
sol = solve(prob,Tsit5(),callback=cb)
plot(sol)
```

![Linear Decay Dose](../assets/lineardecay_2dose.png)

Notice that this version will automatically set the `tstops` for you.

### Example 2: A Control Problem

Another example of a `DiscreteCallback` is the [control problem demonstrated on the DiffEq-specific arrays page](@ref control_problem).

### Example 3: AutoAbstol

MATLAB's Simulink has the option for [an automatic absolute tolerance](https://www.mathworks.com/help/simulink/gui/absolute-tolerance.html).
In this example we will implement a callback which will add this behavior to
any JuliaDiffEq solver which implments the `integrator` and callback interface.

The algorithm is as follows. The default value is set to start at `1e-6`, though
we will give the user an option for this choice. Then as the simulation progresses,
at each step the absolute tolerance is set to the maximum value that has been
reached so far times the relative tolerance. This is the behavior that we will
implement in `affect!`.

Since the effect is supposed to occur every timestep, we use the trivial condition:

```julia
condition = function (u,t,integrator)
    true
end
```

which always returns true. For our effect we will overload the call on a type.
This type will have a value for the current maximum. By doing it this way, we
can store the current state for the running maximum. The code is as follows:

```julia
mutable struct AutoAbstolAffect{T}
  curmax::T
end
# Now make `affect!` for this:
function (p::AutoAbstolAffect)(integrator)
  p.curmax = max(p.curmax,integrator.u)
  integrator.opts.abstol = p.curmax * integrator.opts.reltol
  u_modified!(integrator,false)
end
```

This makes `affect!(integrator)` use an internal mutating value `curmax` to update
the absolute tolerance of the integrator as the algorithm states.

Lastly, we can wrap it in a nice little constructor:

```julia
function AutoAbstol(save=true;init_curmax=1e-6)
  affect! = AutoAbstolAffect(init_curmax)
  condtion = (u,t,integrator) -> true
  save_positions = (save,false)
  DiscreteCallback(condtion,affect!,save_positions=save_positions)
end
```

This creates the `DiscreteCallback` from the `affect!` and `condition` functions
that we implemented. Now

```julia
cb = AutoAbstol(save=true;init_curmax=1e-6)
```

returns the callback that we created. We can then solve an equation using this
by simply passing it with the `callback` keyword argument. Using the integrator
interface rather than the solve interface, we can step through one by one
to watch the absolute tolerance increase:

```julia
integrator = init(prob,BS3(),callback=cb)
at1 = integrator.opts.abstol
step!(integrator)
at2 = integrator.opts.abstol
@test at1 < at2
step!(integrator)
at3 = integrator.opts.abstol
@test at2 < at3
```

Note that this example is contained in the [Callback Library](@ref callback_library),
a library of useful callbacks for JuliaDiffEq solvers.

## ContinuousCallback Examples

### Example 1: Bouncing Ball

Let's look at the bouncing ball. Let the first variable `y` is the height which
changes by `v` the velocity, where the velocity is always changing at `-g` which
is the gravitational constant. This is the equation:

```julia
function f(du,u,p,t)
  du[1] = u[2]
  du[2] = -p
end
```

All we have to do in order to specify the event is to have a function which
should always be positive with an event occurring at 0. For now at least
that's how it's specified. If a generalization is needed we can talk about
this (but it needs to be "root-findable"). For here it's clear that we just
want to check if the ball's height ever hits zero:

```julia
function condition(u,t,integrator) # Event when event_f(u,t) == 0
  u[1]
end
```

Notice that here we used the values `u` instead of the value from the `integrator`.
This is because the values `u,t` will be appropriately modified at the interpolation
points, allowing for the rootfinding behavior to occur.

Now we have to say what to do when the event occurs. In this case we just
flip the velocity (the second variable)

```julia
function affect!(integrator)
  integrator.u[2] = -integrator.u[2]
end
```

The callback is thus specified by:

```julia
cb = ContinuousCallback(condition,affect!)
```

Then you can solve and plot:

```julia
u0 = [50.0,0.0]
tspan = (0.0,15.0)
p = 9.8
prob = ODEProblem(f,u0,tspan,p)
sol = solve(prob,Tsit5(),callback=cb)
plot(sol)
```

![BallBounce](../assets/ballbounce.png)

As you can see from the resulting image, DifferentialEquations.jl is smart enough
to use the interpolation to hone in on the time of the event and apply the event
back at the correct time. Thus one does not have to worry about the adaptive timestepping
"overshooting" the event as this is handled for you. Notice that the event macro
will save the value(s) at the discontinuity.

The callback is robust to having multiple discontinuities occur. For example,
we can integrate for long time periods and get the desired behavior:

```julia
u0 = [50.0,0.0]
tspan = (0.0,100.0)
prob = ODEProblem(f,u0,tspan,p)
sol = solve(prob,Tsit5(),callback=cb)
plot(sol,plotdensity=10000)
```

![bounce_long](../assets/bounce_long.png)

### Example 2: Terminating an Integration

In many cases you might want to terminate an integration when some condition is
satisfied. To terminate an integration, use `terminate!(integrator)` as the `affect!`
in a callback.

In this example we will solve the differential equation:

```julia
u0 = [1.,0.]
function fun2(du,u,p,t)
   du[2] = -u[1]
   du[1] = u[2]
end
tspan = (0.0,10.0)
prob = ODEProblem(fun2,u0,tspan)
```

which has cosine and -sine as the solutions respectively. We wish to solve until
the sine part, `u[2]` becomes positive. There are two things we may be looking for.

A `DiscreteCallback` will cause this to halt at the first step such that the condition
is satisfied. For example, we could use:

```julia
condition(u,t,integrator) = u[2]>0
affect!(integrator) = terminate!(integrator)
cb = DiscreteCallback(condition,affect!)
sol = solve(prob,Tsit5(),callback=cb)
```

![discrete_terminate](../assets/discrete_terminate.png)

However, in many cases we wish to halt exactly at the point of time that the
condition is satisfied. To do that, we use a continuous callback. The condition
must thus be a function which is zero at the point we want to halt. Thus we
use the following:

```julia
condition(u,t,integrator) = u[2]
affect!(integrator) = terminate!(integrator)
cb = ContinuousCallback(condition,affect!)
sol = solve(prob,Tsit5(),callback=cb)
```

![simple_terminate](../assets/simple_terminate.png)

Note that this uses rootfinding to approximate the "exact" moment of the crossing.
Analytically we know the value is `pi`, and here the integration terminates at

```julia
sol.t[end] # 3.1415902502224307
```

Using a more accurate integration increases the accuracy of this prediction:

```julia
sol = solve(prob,Vern8(),callback=cb,reltol=1e-12,abstol=1e-12)
sol.t[end] # 3.1415926535896035
#π = 3.141592653589703...
```

Now say we wish to find the when the first period is over, i.e. we want to ignore
the upcrossing and only stop on the downcrossing. We do this by ignoring the
`affect!` and only passing an `affect!` for the second:

```julia
condition(u,t,integrator) = u[2]
affect!(integrator) = terminate!(integrator)
cb = ContinuousCallback(condition,nothing,affect!)
sol = solve(prob,Tsit5(),callback=cb)
```

![downcrossing_terminate](../assets/downcrossing_terminate.png)

Notice that passing only one `affect!` is the same as
`ContinuousCallback(condition,affect!,affect!)`, i.e. both upcrossings and
downcrossings will activate the event. Using
`ContinuousCallback(condition,affect!,nothing)`will thus be the same as above
because the first event is an upcrossing.

### Example 3: Growing Cell Population

Another interesting issue is with models of changing sizes. The ability to handle
such events is a unique feature of DifferentialEquations.jl! The problem we would
like to tackle here is a cell population. We start with 1 cell with a protein `X`
which increases linearly with time with rate parameter `α`. Since we are going
to be changing the size of the population, we write the model in the general form:

```julia
const α = 0.3
function f(du,u,p,t)
  for i in 1:length(u)
    du[i] = α*u[i]
  end
end
```

Our model is that, whenever the protein `X` gets to a concentration of 1, it
triggers a cell division. So we check to see if any concentrations hit 1:

```julia
function condition(u,t,integrator) # Event when event_f(u,t) == 0
  1-maximum(u)
end
```

Again, recall that this function finds events as when `condition==0`,
so `1-maximum(u)` is positive until a cell has a concentration of `X` which is
1, which then triggers the event. At the event, we have that the cell splits
into two cells, giving a random amount of protein to each one. We can do this
by resizing the cache (adding 1 to the length of all of the caches) and setting
the values of these two cells at the time of the event:

```julia
function affect!(integrator)
  u = integrator.u
  resize!(integrator,length(u)+1)
  maxidx = findmax(u)[2]
  Θ = rand()
  u[maxidx] = Θ
  u[end] = 1-Θ
  nothing
end
```

As noted in the [Integrator Interface](@ref integrator), `resize!(integrator,length(integrator.u)+1)`
is used to change the length of all of the internal caches (which includes `u`)
to be their current length + 1, growing the ODE system. Then the following code
sets the new protein concentrations. Now we can solve:

```julia
callback = ContinuousCallback(condition,affect!)
u0 = [0.2]
tspan = (0.0,10.0)
prob = ODEProblem(f,u0,tspan)
sol = solve(prob,callback=callback)
```

The plot recipes do not have a way of handling the changing size, but we can
plot from the solution object directly. For example, let's make a plot of how
many cells there are at each time. Since these are discrete values, we calculate
and plot them directly:

```julia
plot(sol.t,map((x)->length(x),sol[:]),lw=3,
     ylabel="Number of Cells",xlabel="Time")
```

![NumberOfCells](../assets/numcells.png)

Now let's check-in on a cell. We can still use the interpolation to get a nice
plot of the concentration of cell 1 over time. This is done with the command:

```julia
ts = range(0, stop=10, length=100)
plot(ts,map((x)->x[1],sol.(ts)),lw=3,
     ylabel="Amount of X in Cell 1",xlabel="Time")
```

![Cell1](../assets/cell1.png)

Notice that every time it hits 1 the cell divides, giving cell 1 a random amount
of `X` which then grows until the next division.

Note that one macro which was not shown in this example is `deleteat!` on the caches.
For example, to delete the second cell, we could use:

```julia
deleteat!(integrator,2)
```

This allows you to build sophisticated models of populations with births and deaths.

## VectorContinuousCallback Example

### Example 1: Bouncing Ball with multiple walls

This is similar to the above Bouncing Ball example, but now we have two more vertical walls, at `x = 0` and `x = 10.0`. We have our ODEFunction as -

```julia
function f(du,u,p,t)
  du[1] = u[2]
  du[2] = -p
  du[3] = u[4]
  du[4] = 0.0
end
```

where `u[1]` denotes `y`-coordinate, `u[2]` denotes velocity in `y`-direction, `u[3]` denotes `x`-coordinate and `u[4]` denotes velocity in `x`-direction. We will make a `VectorContinuousCallback` of length 2 - one for `x` axis collision, one for walls parallel to `y` axis.

```julia
function condition(out,u,t,integrator) # Event when event_f(u,t) == 0
  out[1] = u[1]
  out[2] = (u[3] - 10.0)u[3]
end

function affect!(integrator, idx)
  if idx == 1
    integrator.u[2] = -0.9integrator.u[2]
  elseif idx == 2
    integrator.u[4] = -0.9integrator.u[4]
  end
end

cb = VectorContinuousCallback(condition,affect!,2)
```

It is evident that `out[2]` will be zero when `u[3]` (x-coordinate) is either `0.0` or `10.0`. And when that happens, we flip the velocity with some coefficient of restitution (`0.9`).

Completeting rest of the code-
```julia
u0 = [50.0,0.0,0.0,2.0]
tspan = (0.0,15.0)
p = 9.8
prob = ODEProblem(f,u0,tspan,p)
sol = solve(prob,Tsit5(),callback=cb,dt=1e-3,adaptive=false)
plot(sol,vars=(1,3))
```
And you get the following output:

![Cell1](../assets/ball2.png)
